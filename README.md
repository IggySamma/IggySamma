Hi,

My name is IggySamma, and I am currently self-teaching software development. 
I am focusing on mastering programming languages through hands-on projects, relying on official documentation for guidance. 
My approach is to learn the fundamentals without the use of frameworks, with the goal of becoming a well-rounded generalist developer.
