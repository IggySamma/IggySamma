Hi I'm IggySamma,

Currently self-teaching to become a developer.
Teaching myself with my ideas and then just going to docs.
Not using any frameworks to learn the basics of languages and learning to become a generalist.

Currently working on a website for my significant other's hobby, and using it as my basis to learn about web development.
I don't plan on being a web dev, but just my first project to get into development and get an understanding of how the web works.
